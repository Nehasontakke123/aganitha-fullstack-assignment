# AI-Assisted Development Disclosure

## How I Used AI to Build This Project

This Earthquake Visualizer application was built with the assistance of Claude AI (Anthropic's AI assistant). Here's how AI was utilized:

### 1. **Project Planning & Architecture**
- AI helped design the component structure and folder organization
- Proposed the tech stack selection (React, Vite, Tailwind, Leaflet)
- Suggested separation of concerns (services, components, utilities)

### 2. **Code Generation**
- Generated initial boilerplate for all React components
- Created the API service layer for USGS data integration
- Implemented filtering, searching, and sorting logic
- Built the map visualization with Leaflet integration

### 3. **Styling & UI/UX**
- Applied Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design
- Designed the color-coded magnitude legend system
- Created a clean, modern interface with proper spacing and typography

### 4. **Feature Implementation**
- Implemented real-time data fetching with error handling
- Created CSV export functionality
- Built the search and filter capabilities
- Added accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### 5. **Documentation**
- Generated comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Created detailed deployment guides for Vercel and CodeSandbox
- Documented the code with inline comments

### 6. **Quality Assurance**
- AI suggested best practices for React hooks and state management
- Recommended error handling patterns
- Ensured proper TypeScript-like prop documentation with JSDoc comments

### 7. **Testing**
- Created example test file structure with Vitest
- Suggested testing strategies for components

### My Role
While AI generated much of the code, I:
- Provided the initial requirements and specifications
- Reviewed and selected appropriate suggestions from AI
- Made architectural decisions about feature prioritization
- Tested the application to ensure it works correctly
- Customized the UI/UX to match the assignment requirements
- Added the Candidate ID and completed the submission

### AI Tool Used
- **Claude AI** (via Cursor IDE integration) for code generation and refactoring

This disclosure demonstrates ethical use of AI in software development by being transparent about the development process.
